üëã Hello,

I am a Chemistry graduate with a Master's degree in Computational Chemistry, and
currently a PhD student in the [Materials Modeling & Design Group][mmdg] at
[University of Crete][uoc], specializing in the application of Machine Learning
(ML) techniques to study gas adsorption in porous materials. My research focuses
on developing and applying ML algorithms for predicting gas adsorption
properties of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). If you are interested in learning more about
machine learning and deep learning, you can take a look at my [master
thesis](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adosar/master_thesis/master/master.pdf)
. Beyond my research, I enjoy problem-solving, coding and learning new things
about computers and Artificial Intelligence. Additionally, I have a deep passion
for watches, especially the mechanical ones ‚ù§Ô∏è.

> If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
